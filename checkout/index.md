Swedbank Pay Checkout allows your customers to be identified with Swedbank Pay,
enabling existing Swedbank Pay Checkout users to pay with their favorite payment
methods in just a few simple steps.

## Prerequisites

To start integrating Swedbank Pay Checkout, you need the following:

* [HTTPS][https] enabled web server
* Agreement that includes Swedbank Pay Checkout
* Obtained credentials (merchant Access Token) from Swedbank Pay through
  Swedbank Pay Admin. Please observe that Swedbank Pay Checkout encompass
  both the **`consumer`** and **`paymentmenu`** scope

## Introduction

To get started with Swedbank Pay Checkout, you should learn about its different
components and how they work together. Swedbank Pay Checkout consists of two related,
but disconnected concepts: **Checkin** and **Payment Menu**. Checkin identifies
the consumer in our Consumer API and Payment Menu authorizes the payment with
our Payment Menu API. The next step is to **Capture** the payment. You can either
capture the total amount, or do a part-capture (as described under 'After Payment'). Connect these steps and you have
Swedbank Pay Checkout.

Under, you will see a sequence diagram showing the sequence of a Swedbank Pay checkout.
Note that in this diagram, the Payer refers to the merchant front-end (website)
while Merchant refers to the merchant back-end.

### Explanations

Under, you see a list of notes that explains some of the sequences in the diagram. 

#### Checkin

[1] 'rel: view-consumer-identification' is a value in one of the operations,
sent as a response from Swedbank Pay to the Merchant. <br>
[2] 'Initiate Consumer Hosted View (open iframe)' creates the iframe. <br>
[3] 'Show Consumer UI page in iframe' displays the checkin form as content inside
of the iframe. <br>
[4] 'onConsumerIdentified (consumerProfileRef)' is an event that triggers when the
consumer has been identified, and delivers<br> a property 'consumerProfileRef' as a
reference to be used in the payment menu.

#### Payment Menu

[5] 'Authorize Payment' is when the payer has accepted the payment.
