## API requests

The API requests are displayed in the [invoice flow][invoice-flow]. The options you can choose from when creating a payment with key operation set to Value FinancingConsumer are listed below. The general REST based API model is described in the [technical reference][technical-reference].

### Options before posting a payment

{:.table .table-striped}
| **POST Request** |	Finland ![fi.png][fi-png]  |
| **Operation** |	FinancingConsumer |
| **Intent** | Authorization |
| **Currency** | EUR |
| **InvoiceType** |	PayExFinancingFI |

*   An invoice payment is always two-phased based - Â you create an Authorize transaction, that is followed by a Capture or Cancel request.
*   **Defining CallbackURL**: When implementing a scenario, it is optional to set a [CallbackURL][callback-url] in the `POST` request. If callbackURL is set PayEx will send a postback request to this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the payment. [See the Callback API description here.][callback-api]
