## API requests

The API requests are displayed in the [invoice flow][invoice-flow]. The options you can choose from when creating a payment with key operation set to Value FinancingConsumer are listed below. The general REST based API model is described in the [technical reference][technical-reference].

### Options before posting a payment

{:.table .table-striped}
| **POST Request** |	Finland ![Finish flag][fi-png]  |
| **Operation** |	FinancingConsumer |
| **Intent** | Authorization |
| **Currency** | EUR |
| **InvoiceType** |	PayExFinancingFI |

*   An invoice payment is always two-phased based - Â you create an Authorize transaction, that is followed by a Capture or Cancel request.
*   **Defining CallbackURL**: When implementing a scenario, it is optional to set a [CallbackURL][callback-url] in the `POST` request. If callbackURL is set PayEx will send a postback request to this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the payment. [See the Callback API description here.][callback-api]


### Problem messages

When performing unsuccessful operations, the eCommerce API will respond with a problem message. We generally use the problem message type and status code to identify the nature of the problem. The problem name and description will often help narrow down the specifics of the problem.

For general information about problem messages and error handling,[visit error handling and problem details][technical-reference-problem-details].
