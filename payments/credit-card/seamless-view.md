## Introduction 

* When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the 
purchase process, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your
 Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique 
 `paymentID`. You will receive a **JavaScript source** in response.
* You need to embed the script source on your site to create a 
[Hosted View][hosted-view] in an iFrame; so that she can enter the credit card 
details in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment.
* Swedbank Pay will handle 3D-secure authentication when this is required.
* Swedbank Pay will display directly in the iFrame - one of two specified URLs, 
depending on whether the payment session is followed through completely or 
cancelled beforehand. Please note that both a successful and rejected payment 
reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled payment.
* When you detect that the payer reach your `completeUrl` , you need to do a 
`GET` request to receive the state of the transaction, containing the 
`paymentID` generated in the first step, to receive the state of the 
transaction.

### Payment Url

For our Seamless View, the URL property called `paymentUrl` will be used if the 
consumer is redirected out of the hosted view frame (iFrame) through our 
[Credit Card API][purchase]. The consumer is redirected out of frame when at 
the 3d secure verification for credit card payments. The `paymentURL` should 
represent the page of where the payment hosted view was hosted originally, 
such as the checkout page, shopping cart page, or similar. Basically, 
`paymentUrl` should be set to the same URL as that of the page where the 
JavaScript for the hosted payment view was added to in order to initiate the 
payment. Please note that the `paymentUrl` must be able to invoke the same 
JavaScript URL from the same Payment as the one that initiated the payment 
originally, so it should include some sort of state identifier in the URL. 
The state identifier is the ID of the order, shopping cart or similar that has 
the URL of the Payment stored.

With `paymentUrl` in place, the retry process becomes much more convenient for 
both the integration and the payer.

## Screenshots 

You will redirect the payer to Swedbank Pay hosted pages to collect the credit 
card information.

## API Requests

The API requests are displayed in the [purchase flow](#purchase-flow-mobile). 
You can [create a card `payment`][create-payment] with following `operation` 
options:
* [Purchase][purchase]
* [Recur][recur]
* [Payout][payout]
* [Verify][verify]

Our `payment` example below uses the [`purchase`][purchase] value.

### Type of authorization - Intent

The intent of the payment identifies how and when the charge will be 
effectuated. This determine the type of transaction used during the payment 
process.

* **PreAuthorization**: A purchase with `PreAuthorization` intent is handled 
in a similar manner as the ordinary authorization procedure. The notable 
difference is that the funds are put on hold for 30 days (for an ordinary 
authorization the funds are reserved for 7 days). Also, with a 
`PreAuthorization`, the captured amount can be higher than the preauthorized 
amount. The amount captured should not be higher than 20% of the original 
amount, due to card brand rules. You complete the purchase by 
[finalizing the transaction][finalize].
* **Authorization (two-phase)**: If you want the credit card to reserve the 
amount, you will have to specify that the intent of the purchase is 
Authorization. The amount will be reserved but not charged. You will later 
(i.e. when you are ready to ship the purchased products) have to make a 
[Capture][capture] or [Cancel][cancel] request.
* **AutoCapture (one-phase)**:  If you want the credit card to be charged right 
away, you will have to specify that the intent of the purchase is `AutoCapture`.
 The credit card will be charged automatically after authorization and you don't
  need to do any more financial operations to this purchase.



### General

* **No 3D Secure and card acceptance**: There are optional paramers that can be 
used in relation to 3d-secure and card acceptance. By default, most credit card
 agreements with an acquirer will require that you use 3D-Secure for card holder
 authentication. However, if your agreement allows you to make a card payment
 without this authentication, or that specific cards can be declined, you may 
 adjust these optional parameters when posting in the payment. This is specified
  in the technical reference section for creating credit card payments Â - you 
will find the link in the sequence diagram below.
* **Defining `callbackURL`**: When implementing a scenario, it is optional to 
set a `callbackURL` in the `POST` request. If `callbackURL` is set Swedbank Pay 
will send a postback request to this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the 
payment. [See the Callback API description here][callback].


## Purchase flow
The sequence diagram below shows a high level description of a complete 
purchase, and the requests you have to send to Swedbank Pay. The links will take
 you directly to the corresponding API description.

When dealing with credit card payments, 3D-Secure authentication of the 
cardholder is an essential topic. There are two alternative outcome of a credit 
card payment:

* 3D-Secure enabled - by default, 3D-secure should be enabled, and Swedbank Pay 
will check if the card is enrolled with 3D-secure. This depends on the issuer of
 the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3D-Secure, no authentication of the 
 cardholder is done.
* Card supports 3D-Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3D-Secure, Swedbank Pay
 will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is decided by 
 the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile BankID.

### Options after posting a payment

* `Abort`: It is possible to abort the process, if the payment has no successful
 transactions. [See the PATCH payment description][abort].  
* If the payment shown above is done as a two phase (`Authorization`), you will 
need to implement the [`Capture`][capture] and [`Cancel`][cancel] requests.  
* For `reversals`, you will need to implement the [Reversal request][reversal]. 
* If you did a `PreAuthorization`, you will have to send a 
[Finalize request][finalize] to finalize the transaction.  
* *If `callbackURL` is set:* Whenever changes to the payment occur a 
[Callback request][callback] will be posted to the `callbackUrl`, which was 
generated when the payment was created.
