## After payment options for Mobile Pay

### Options after posting a payment

* **Abort:** It is possible to [abort a payment][technical-reference-abort] if the payment has no successful transactions.
* If the payment shown above is done as a twophase (`authorization`), you will need to implement the Capture and Cancel requests.
* For reversals, you will need to implement the Reversal request.
* **If CallbackURL is set:** Whenever changes to the payment occur Â a [Callback request][technical-reference-callback] will be posted to the callbackUrl, generated when the payment was created.

### Capture Sequence

Capture can only be done on a authorized transaction. It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount than the authorization amount. You can later do more captures on the sam payment upto the total authorization amount.
