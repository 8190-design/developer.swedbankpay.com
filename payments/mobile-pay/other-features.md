### Capture Sequence

Capture can only be perfomed on a payment with a successfully authorized transaction. It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount than the authorized amount. You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total authorization amount.

```mermaid

  Merchant->PayEx: POST [creditcard captures][credit-card-capture]
  Activate Merchant
  Activate PayEx
  PayEx-->Merchant: transaction resource
  Deactivate PayEx
  Deactivate Merchant
```

### Cancel Sequence

Cancel can only be done on a authorized transaction. If you do cancel after doing a part-capture you will cancel the difference between the captured amount and the authorized amount.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Merchant->PayEx: POST [creditcard cancellations][credit-card-cancel]
  Activate Merchant
  Activate PayEx
  PayEx-->Merchant: transaction resource
  Deactivate PayEx
  Deactivate Merchant
```

### Reversal Sequence

Reversal can only be done on a payment where there are some captured amount not yet reversed.

```mermaid

  Merchant->PayEx: POST [creditcard reversals][credit-card-reversal]
  Activate Merchant
  Activate PayEx
  PayEx-->Merchant: transaction resource
  Deactivate PayEx
  Deactivate Merchant
